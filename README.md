# SL-LxxL_Pro Scissor Lift Project
## Overview
The SL-LxxL_Pro Scissor Lift is a cutting-edge solution designed to enhance efficiency and safety on construction sites. This project represents a comprehensive effort to design a portable, sustainable, and highly functional scissor lift capable of addressing the diverse needs of modern construction projects. It combines advanced engineering principles with environmental consciousness, resulting in a product that not only meets but exceeds industry standards for safety, functionality, and environmental impact.

## Detailed Description
The SL-LxxL_Pro Scissor Lift was developed by a team of engineering students at Ontario Tech University, focusing on the creation of a versatile lifting device suitable for a variety of construction environments. The design features a robust electric hydraulic lifting system powered by modular batteries, making it suitable for sites without direct electrical access. It reaches up to 14 feet and supports up to 450 lbs, with easy disassembly and transport capabilities designed for a two-person crew.

### Key innovations include:

- Environmental Sustainability: Utilizes recycled aluminum and biodegradable hydraulic fluids to minimize environmental impact.
- Advanced Safety Features: Equipped with an emergency stop, rubber grips, hazard lights, and comprehensive safety rails to ensure operator safety.
- High Portability: Engineered for quick assembly and disassembly, facilitating easy movement across different levels of a construction site without the need for heavy machinery.

## Repository Contents
- /CAD Files - All CAD drawings and 3D models created in SolidWorks.
- /Documentation - Detailed project reports, design specifications, and assembly instructions.
- /Simulations - Simulation files and results to validate design efficacy.
- /Project Management - Excel spreadsheets for component tracking and project timelines.
  
## Installation
To access and use the design files:

1. Clone the repo: git clone https://github.com/bashirumer/SL-LxxL_Pro-Scissor-Lift.git
2. Navigate to the CAD Files directory.
3. Open the files in SolidWorks or a compatible CAD viewer.
4. 
## Usage
- For Construction Teams: Consult the Documentation folder for assembly instructions and safety guidelines before setup and use at the construction site.
- For Developers and Engineers: Access the CAD Files and Simulations to modify designs or adapt the lift for specific needs.
